					<h2>Things that are happening in December </h2>	
	<p>
						We're not ones for tinsel, but we certainly like to get in the festive mood, so we've saved up some really special beery treats for the month of December.  Every day we'll be opening a door on our beery-advent-calendar.  Also here are some specific goings-on
					</p>
<!-- Scandi Fest -->
					<h3> Scandi Fest - Friday 2nd onwards... </h3>
					<p>
Beers from ToOl, Mikkeller, Aegir, Beerbliotek, etc. Norwich has never seen anything like it before! (Not that we like to blow our own trumpet...)
				</p>

<!-- NR3 Bottle Share -->
					<h3> NR3 Bottle Share - Tues 6th Dec  </h3>
					<p>
	NR3 Bottle Share has been a success so far this year so we're celebrating with a crawl starting at the Fat Cat Tap (where they will present some bottles of beer) and then wandering down the road (maybe via some pubs...) to the Plasterers where we've got some treats in store.  No need to bring anything.  Except a scarf maybe.
					</p>

						<h3> Port & Cheese Tasting, Tues 13th  </h3> 
					</a>
					<p>
Rob from Harper Wells is kindly bringing some riotous ports to taste with some delicious local cheese.  We're tasting a rather splendid Warre's 1983 vintage, which is really going to make the whole thing a very special occasion.  <a href='https://theplasterers.yapsody.com/event/index/55592'>Tickets available here or over the bar.</a>
					</p>
					
<!-- Into Something -->
					<h3> Into Something Fri 16th Dec </h3>

<!-- Big Fat Quiz -->
					<h3> Big Fat Quiz Of The Year - Mon 19th Dec </h3>
					<p>
Loosely based on the famous Channel 4 program, come and test your memory of the last year and collectively cross your fingers that we don't get sued for stealing their format.
					</p>	
					
<!-- Stout & Oysters -->
					<h3> Stout & Oyster Tasting - Tues 20th Dec </h3>
					<p>
Hurrah! It's time for our (as of this year) annual stout and Porter tasting! 
<br><br>
We're going to serve up a selection of our favourite bottled (plus maybe a couple draught) dark beers from the last year and a couple of rare one-off treats... 
<br><br>
We're also going to serve up some oysters this year - don't worry though, if you're squeamish you won't have to join in. But it is the perfect match!!
<br><br>
As ever we'll just split the cost of all the beers equally between those that turn up to keep it affordable as possible and to ensure we get to open as many awesome beers as possible. So it should be about Â£7 plus extra if you want oysters too.

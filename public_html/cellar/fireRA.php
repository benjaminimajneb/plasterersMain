IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY

MEANS OF ESCAPE
The ground floor has two single door-ways (850cm wide) leading to the street which is a point of relative safety.  There is a non-public rear exit from the ground floor via the kitchen, along a passageway onto the street.  

The first floor is exited via a staircase which leads into the passage way behind the pub, from the kitchen.  There is an internal staircase which leads down from the residential kitchen on the first floor down to the main bar area in the pub. This exit is locked to avoid public access up into the flat, but is un-lockable in an emergency from the residential side using a key stored in an emergency break-glass box.

The cellar leads up into the area behind the bar which leads in turn to any of the three exits on the ground floor.   The beer hatch is also accessible by foot, from the other end of the cellar, however this is not ideal as it is not designed as a means of exit.  As such, numbers in the cellar are limited to fewer than 4 people at any time as access is restricted in the event of an emergency.

Thus are four main exits from the building, with no point on the ground floor being more than 70 ft from at least two exits of at least 1m at its narrowest point.  The upstairs area served by exit via stairwell, so in event of a fire on the ground floor, the main room does not need to be crossed.  Upstairs area only has means of escape via the stairwell, accessed by one door leaving the room. As such it is imperative that the stairwell area is kept clear at all times, and is lit clearly.  Also the numbers upstairs should be limited to under 10 due to there being only one exit from the room.

The area outside the escape points is clear, and the building surrounded by open space, so fire is unlikely to spread away from the building, as such a designated meeting point on the other side of the road from the building will serve as a point of safety.

All exits are served by doors which have old fittings and do not necessarily open outwards. 

DISABLED ACCESS
All exit ways are via doors on the ground floor, as such exiting in the event of an emergency will present no problem for wheelchair users.  It is recommended that staff are aware that in the event of an emergency wheelchair users may slow the flow of public from exits, and should 

MEANS OF ALERTING OCCUPANTS IN EVENT OF FIRE
A fire alarm system is installed in the building.  The control panel for this is behind the bar.  There are smoke detectors in all rooms and a break glass point in the kitchen.  The alarm system is audible throughout the building in all floors when it sounds.

MEANS FOR REDUCING SPREAD OF FIRE
Fire is likely to spread quickly through the building’s construction, and furthermore other flammable sources may fuel a fire and cause it to spread to other soft furnishings and furniture.  As far as is reasonably practical no flammable curtains or furniture not made to be fire retardant should be used on site. The distance between likely sources of fire is sufficient enough to warrant fire extinguishers at all possible sources of ignition, i.e. at the end of the bar, in the kitchen, by the woodburner stove, and upstairs in the residential area.

SUMMARY
All staff made aware of Risk Assessment and policy as soon as they commence working for the company.  They are to be trained on arrival, and all possessions checked to ensure no prohibited or hazardous materials are brought onto the site.  Staff to be trained on evacuation procedure.  They will remove all waste materials after use.

Emergency lights and fire alarm system is installed throughout the building.  Exit paths, around escape doors, and in stairwell areas to be kept clear at all times.  Staff to be vigilant and constantly monitoring that escape routes are clear.

Kitchen staff trained on the pub Risk Assessment and emergency action plan, usage of cooking equipment, and shut-off valves for cooking equipment supply.

All electrical equipment and access to controlled areas limited to responsible persons.  Use of cookery equipment monitored.  Premises will be securely locked (windows and doors) out of hours.

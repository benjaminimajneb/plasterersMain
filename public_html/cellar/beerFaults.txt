FAULT WITH THE BEER

Beer not pulling through

Beer pulling through hazy

Beer tastes sour


Turn off tap and unscrew hose

But hose in bucket of clean water, pull through hand pump until it runs clear

Put hose in bucket of water with 1 cap of line clean

Pull through a couple of jugs, leave for ten minutes

Pull through another couple of jugs, leave for ten minutes.

Put hose in clean bucket of water, pull through four jugs
